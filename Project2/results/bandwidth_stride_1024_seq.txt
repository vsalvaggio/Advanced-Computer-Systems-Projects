Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker - v3.11b
Command line parameters: --peak_injection_bandwidth -c0 -l1024 

Using buffer size of 100.000MiB/thread for reads and an additional 100.000MiB/thread for writes
*** Unable to modify prefetchers (try executing 'modprobe msr')
*** So, enabling random access for latency measurements

Measuring Peak Injection Memory Bandwidths for the system
Bandwidths are in MB/sec (1 MB/sec = 1,000,000 Bytes/sec)
Using all the threads from each core if Hyper-threading is enabled
Using traffic with the following read-write ratios
ALL Reads        :	22028.0	
3:1 Reads-Writes :	26982.7	
2:1 Reads-Writes :	26766.8	
1:1 Reads-Writes :	25081.5	
Stream-triad like:	24255.9
